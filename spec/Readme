Specs must be run from lake/spec.  Adding the spec tasks to lake would add them
to the local rakes of actual papers, which is probably undesirable.

To add a directory-induced spec, see lake/spec/auto/simple-build as an example.
Basically, setup a subtree (sans lake/) somewhere in lake/spec/auto.  Then, in the
root of that subtree, add a .test.yaml file that specifies what tasks to run,
and what the expectations of each run is, namely

	1. What files should be produced.
	2. What output should be produced.
	3. What the exit code should be.
