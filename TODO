* Synchronize seguo, hera, and cerberus via commit hooks

* Add rake as submodule from github

* Add lake command that runs rake by default and creates new paper projects
   with switch for different types and adds commits hooks for the lake
   submodule to push changes to wips on the central server
		- checks out git repo in ~/.lake/repo
		- makes submodules that symlink to this local repo
			This will solve the Prem problem.
		- creates from templates better

*  Graphics:  1) better error messages, as when transfig or what not
is not installed and 2) try to continue as much as possible.

* Extract all fixes from gitlantic.

* Handle multiple masters.
	given a project with two master tex files foo and bar,
	rake		# builds all (here foo and bar) and views the first in 
				# lexicographic order (bar)
	rake bar	# builds and views bar
	rake bar.pdf	# builds bar
	rake pdf	# build first pdf (in this case bar)
	rake pdfs	# build all pdfs
	
    Lake should detect whether MASTER_TEX_FILES is nil and gracefully fail.
	This happens with my dissertation because paper.master is the actual checked
	in version of paper.tex.

    Need to find consensus on which pdf to view when there are multiple
    masters and pdf not explicitly set.  Perhaps set explicitly in 
    Rakefile.local

* Test harness

     - Add regression tests for the citation bug
     - Add test for needless bibtex execution (from Zhendong field proposal)

* Write documentation

    README
	    authors
	    installation instructions
	    description & features
	Add a Bibtex subsection to the Usage section.
	Complete list of suffixes that Lake recognizes somewhere in the Usage
	section, not sure where.

* scrub templates (any else?)

	git filter-branch --tree-filter /tmp/fix-one-tree.rb HEAD
	git filter-branch --tree-filter 'if [ -d templates/pluq ]; then mv templates/pluq templates/work; fi'
