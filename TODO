1.  Centralize all lake repos to hera.

2.  Problem with fls-based dependency and intentionally removed files
   a.  Make fls before *every* potential build.  Run pdflatex
  -draftmode -interaction batchmode -recorder.
   b.  If it fails, just try to build to report the error to the user

3.  Always use -interaction batchmode and look to the log for errors

4.  Graphics:  1) better error messages, as when transfig or what not
is not installed and 2) try to continue as much as possible.

5.  The create-a-repo script.  This is what should check whether or
not lake's package dependencies are met.  Possibly even selecting
different Rakefile that don't have rules for stuff not supported on a
particular platform.

6.  Extract all fixes from gitlantic.



Test harness


Write README

	authors

	installation instructions

	description & features


scrub templates (any else?)

	git filter-branch --tree-filter /tmp/fix-one-tree.rb HEAD
	git filter-branch --tree-filter 'if [ -d templates/pluq ]; then mv templates/pluq templates/work; fi'


Better UI
	lake command
		- checks out git repo in ~/.lake/repo
		- makes submodules that symlink to this local repo
			This will solve the Prem problem.
		- creates from templates better


Fix citations bug (and do so with regression tests!):

    If you add a citation to a tex file and to a bib file, but you're using
    includeonly to build only a subset of a project, the citations will never be
    resolved and you'll uselessly re-run latex max_iterations.

	General approach:

		Slightly less unseriously, we might be able to tackle this by checksumming
		*.aux after each loop and quitting early if it never changes.  This means
		that you only run pdflatex one extra time instead of max iterations.

	Checksumming *.aux does seem to work, although checksumming the pdf does not
	(presumably because of timestamps).

Make bib files dependencies of pdf

Make lake SCM agnostic.  Allow it to work in svn, git, mercurial, etc.  And use
	a design that allows adding new SCMs easily.

Excessive bibtexing:
	The field proposal on which I worked with Zhendong and Prem had master tex
	files with no bibliography, on which lake nonetheless ran bibtex, and
	stopped with an error.

In the field proposal written with Zhendong and Prem, another bib bug cropped
up.  To reproduce, remove the exclusions and try to build all masters in the
project.

Add support for a configuration file to reduce the tedium of copying identical
local Rakefiles into each project.

Earl's todo emails:
	Get rid of the Bib assumption and just discover bib files, then add support
	for exclusions.

	Lake should detect whether MASTER_TEX_FILES is nil and gracefully fail.
	This happens with my dissertation because paper.master is the actual checked
	in version of paper.tex.

	2.  Add a Bibtex subsection to the Usage section.

	3.  Drop the rake view rule in the README, which means that we need to
	implement the new rake build and view behavior.  I advocate this because I
	don't think we should plan to change the fundamental way to use lake shortly
	after release.  On the multiple tex master front, I believe the behavior
	should be to view/reload all pdfs listed, where epsilon = all pdfs.

	4.  Complete list of suffixes that Lake recognizes somewhere in the Usage
	section, not sure where.


Better support for multiple pdfs (was masterexclusions)
	given a project with two master tex files foo and bar,

	rake		# builds all (here foo and bar) and views the first in 
				# lexicographic order (bar)
	rake bar	# builds and views bar
	rake bar.pdf	# builds bar
	rake pdf	# build first pdf (in this case bar)
	rake pdfs	# build all pdfs
