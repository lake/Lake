First latex run generates the \citation and \bibdata in the aux files.
These each occur only in the aux file of the corresponding .tex

First bibtex run reads aux files and created .bbl file containing the
\bibitem's for each citation.

First latex run after bibtex reads .bbl file and writes \bibcite commands
to aux file that contains \bibdata.  And puts the bibliography into pdf.

Second latex run after bibtex uses \bibcite commands to resolve citation numbers
in the pdf.
